# Markdown Notes

This is an outline of my notes from the readings about Markdown. 

**Newly learned Mardown syntax**

1. Markdown headers can also be created by using `===` syntax 
2. Syntax for bold and italizing at the same time is triple atrstiks `***`
3. underscores are created by ``***``
4. blockquotes are ``>``
    *  Indented blockquotes ``>>``   

**Best Pratices**

1.Periods are best for list in place of paranthesis, as they are not always supported. 
2.Indent to create a nested list
