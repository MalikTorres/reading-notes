## Data Structures and Algorithms 


#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

How efficient the data structure you're going to use is for that particular problem. It's important to note if the structure you're choosing may take up more space in memory compared to different.

**Different Datatypes**

- Arrays: structure of fixed sizes
  Operations: Traverse,Search, Update
- Linked list: sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Singly linked list, Double linked list, and circular linked list.
  Operations: Search Insert Delete
- Stacks: Last in Last out, **push(add)** **pop(delete)** **peek(return the top elment of the stack without deleting it)** **isEmpty(check if the stack is empty)**
**isFull(Check if the stack is full)**
- Queues: First in first out **Enqueue** **Dequeue**
- Hash Tables: Values stored with associated keys
    **Applications of hash tables:**
    - Implement database indexes
    - Implement associative arrays
    - Implement set data structure
- Trees Hierarchial structured data(binary search tree)
- Heaps special case search tree
- graphs 
#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

This can be ensured by including a base case, which is the case where the function will no longer call itself.
