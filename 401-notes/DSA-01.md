## Data Structures and Algorithms 


#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

How efficient the data structure you're going to use is for that particular problem. It's important to note if the structure you're choosing may take up more space in memory compared to different.


#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

This can be ensured by including a base case, which is the case where the function will no longer call itself.
