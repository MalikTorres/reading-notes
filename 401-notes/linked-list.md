## Linked List Vocabulary Sheet

 A sequence of `Nodes` that are connected/linked to each other.Each node references the next node in the link.


**Linked:** A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

**Singly:** Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A `Singly` linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference poiints to the `Next` node in the linked list.

**Doubly:** Double refers to there being two double references within the node. A `Doubly` linked list means there is a reference to both the `Next` and `Previous` node

**Node** Nodes are individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link

**Next** Each node contains a property called `Next`. This property contains the reference to the next node.

**Head:** The `Head` is a reference of type `Node` to the first node in a linked list.

**Current:** The `Current` is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new `Current` variable at the `Head` to gurantee you starting from the beginning of the linked list.

**Traversing:** Through a linked list can be done with a `while()` loop.
