## Class 2 Notes


### An introduction to NodeJS and Express

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

  Since the express framework itself doesn't contain necessarily everything a developer may need, middleware has been created by numerous developers to help assist with problems a developer may run into.

Express the most popular web framework.


Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

It essentially means that there aren't many restrictions on the way components can be brought together to complete a specific task.


What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

A module is a JavaScript library/file that can be imported into other code using Node's `require()` function. Modules allow developers to create cleaner more readable code, that is also resuable.


### What is NPM?

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

`9.5.0`

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

`npm install jshint`


### What is TDD?

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Test essentially provides developers a way to ensure what they're developing will work prior to release. Testing within the context of the development has the same connotations as it would in other fields. Generally it's good to test something before use.

What are three expected benefits of testing

  - Reduction of defect rates within teams
  - Reduction in those defect rates within a projects final phases
  - Improved design qualities in code.

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

### CI/CD

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

  - Allows teams to integrate their work continuously 
  - better testing
  - faster code release


What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Devlivery means that the build is always in a deployable state. Continuous Deployment is an automated depoloyment to production.


Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
