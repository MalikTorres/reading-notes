### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

My ability to adapt to the circumstance. Right out of college I was thusted into the mortgage industry. A industry that is extremely convoluted and always changing. Throughout this experience I had to learn concepts and communicate with clients as if I was already an expert. I often had to communicate with clients thrugh highly escalated situations, and change my approach depending on what the problem was very quickly. This required me to constantly change my approach on the spot. I believe this skill greatly translates to problem solving as a software engineer, as the problems we're faced with area always changing.


### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Always plan out my steps before diving into a problem
2. Step away and come back to have a clearer approach
3. Ask for help when I'm using too much time and it's becoming an inefficient.
