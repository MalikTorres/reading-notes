## Growth Mindset Notes

#### Deliberate Practice

It's integral to maintain continual practice when trying to improve technical ability. It also important to make sure that this pratice comes in the form of steps based on conceptual difficulty. As **Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice** mentions, you shouldn't jump to certain difficult challenges if you can't yet iterate over an array.


#### Improving

A growth mindset can lead to a smarter approach when learning new material. We're often taught to seek the reward, but this ideology is very limiting. A lot more can be achieved when the emphasis is on pushing outside of ones comfort zone when learning, can lead to stronger/neuron connections. 

**Grit is built through a marathon approach to our goals.**

#### Expectations

Expectations tend to create a destructive outlook about success. Overtime, humanity has characterized success based on numerous theories that have become rigid. This has become highlighted in the increasing pressures surrounding careers. These perspectives have become counter productive towards well being. 


#### Emotional Intelligence

Throughout this course and prior, my emotional intelligence has remained consistent. An area I look to grow would be my confidence and speak up more if I have an idea.

#### Bias

My results from the assessment were what I assumed they would be. I  want to continue to make sure that I speak out if I notice workplace biases or if I am on the receiving end of any biases.
