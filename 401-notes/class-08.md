### 5 steps to RBAC

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization.  This is relevant because this can very between roles such as user and admin.

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

Admin and user

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- Inventory your systems
  Determine what resources you have for which you need to access
- Analyst your workorce and create roles
  Group your workforce members into roles with common access needs
- Assign people to roles
  Figure out which employee belongs in which role

It essentially is a metholodgy that establishes a ranking for accessing certain systems. Depending on your role you may have more access than another.
