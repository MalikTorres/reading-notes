## Class 9

#### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter which allows us to incorperate Event-Driven-Programming right away. 

#### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Instead of the object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, the objects can emit events and the object that is listening to those events will process it in a way they have been "told to".

#### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

This can help developers avoid over complicating their code, and keep a more organized codebase.


#### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

Having a better grasp of event driven programming


#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

Undersand object oriented programming betterwithin jvaScript

#### Things I want to know more about

Implenting oop concepts along with event driven programming
