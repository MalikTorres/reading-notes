### The Command Line

The Command Line/Terminal is a text based user interface that allows a user to enter in commands that can be then executed. 

These commands can vary greatly depending on the task that you're looking to complete as a user. A few common commands are 

- `pwd` which stands for print working directory.

- `ls` this will list all of the files that are in the current directory.

- `cd` to change directories

- `ls -a` List all of the contents in a directory

- `mkdir` Make Directory

- `touch` to create file

- `mv` to move a file

- `rm` to remove a file

**Paths are antoher important concept to understand when locating a directory such as relative paths and absolute. Each path begins with `/`**
**`Tab` key is shortcut to complete commands being written into the terminal**


The command line is a powerful tool that I feel I do not utilize to its full capacity. I've noticed with most technical related concepts that it can be hard to absorb all of the material soley based on theory but new features become more familiar through experience. So far, my range in the command line is mostly `cd`,`cd..` ,`touch`, `mkdir`. I definately want to start using more of the commands to get more familar and overall be more efficient as a developer. I think that although something like the command line might seem small in the world of development, it can go along way setting yourself a part by being very familiar with it as a new developer entering the industry.
