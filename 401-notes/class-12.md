#### What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

WebSocket is the communication protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the client and the server over a Tcp connection


#### When would you use Socket.IO?

Can handle all the degradation to get full duplex communication in real time.

#### When would you use WebSockets?

One reason is that WebSocket helps in real-time communication between Client and webserver.
