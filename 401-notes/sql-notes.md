# Relational Databases and SQL


SQL appears to be a simply how one can interact with the information that is stored within a database. This is established by the power each of the SQL commands give by searching for the exactly piece of data you're looking for.

Databases can be very convoluted so it is hugely helpful to the user if they have an organized tool at their disposal to extract what is needed from the database. Additionally the relationship aspect of these databases helps to assist with the user finding what they're looking for in each query.

### Definitions

**A relational databases is a collection of related(two dimensional) tables**

## SQL Commands

- SELECT: fetching Data
- MATH: Do math on a result
- FROM: Where to select from
- * Splat: shortcut to get all columns
- ORDER BY: Sort data different then stored in the database(such as reverse)
- ASCending and DEScending Order Direction: Reverse order
- LIMIT and OFFSET: limit and offset results that are returned
- OFFSET: Where to start returning data

### Schemas

SCHEMA is used to describe the collection of tables and their relationships in your database. GOOD visual interfaces can help assist with browsing schemas

#### Schema browsing shortcuts

\d: list of all tables
\d+: list of all relations 
\d [table name] \dn: list of the columns, indexes and relations for the [table name] list of all schemas 
\l: list of all databases
\z: list tables with access privileges

### Mid Level Commands

WHERE: More specifc queries
CONDITIONS: If a statement is true or false
AND: To add addtional conditions
OR: Any condition
NOT: Invert a condition
ORDERING AND PARENTHESIS: Can combine OR and AND commands
OPERATORS:

Operator
= equal
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal
>= greater than or equal
!= not equal
<> not equal

**The importance of the relationship aspect in relational databases is that it allows data that's store to have connection to other tables. If there weren't relationships all the data would be in one large table.**
