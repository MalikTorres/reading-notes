### Project Ideas:

1. A flight tracker system that lets you know when a plane has taken off and arrived. 

2. Some type of cooking timer that sends events based on the progress of the food you are cooking.

Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

I would like to have a better understanding of how to manage queue and events
