## Project Ideas

  1. A grocery store site, where each table in the database is broken down by category that you would see in a traditional grocery store. Those with admin role access can update the items that are avaliable to purchase, and add more to the supply along with remove. Workers can delete items, and customers can purchase.

  2. A travel site that allows users to purchase tickets for flights that are present in the data base.
