### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. Normal flow is the default layout for CSS elements.

2. Block level element contents fill the avalibale inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accomodate its content. Whereas inline elements are just the size of their content. 

3. static positioning is the fault that every element gets. Which means place the elemtn into its normal position in the document flow. 

4. Aboslute positioning is useful in that it can be used to created isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements.

5. Aboslute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor(the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the viewport
