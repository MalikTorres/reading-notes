### Troubleshooting JavaScript

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors are essentially spelling errors and not typing out the code correctly. Logical errors are typycally harder to fix as the output that you're getting from the code is not what you intended/

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Today I had a syntax error where I labled the arguement I was passing into the function incorrectly, which caused my code not run. Additionally I had a logic error where I was iterating over the wrong arrray and not outputting the correct results to the table footer.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I want to start to log to console more often and be more detail oriented. As I log to the console I also want to really read out the error to gain a better understanding of what the error is.


### The JavaScript Debugger


How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

JavaScript denbugger essentially serves as a pause point in your code or process where you can analyze what is preventing you from moving forward.

Define what a breakpoint is.

Breakpoints are where you can pause the execution of your code.

What is the call stack?

The call stack represents what code was executed to get to the current line of code you're on.
