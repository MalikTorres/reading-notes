### Learn HTML

1. When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?
    `<ul>` ordered are useful for non meaningful changes, whereas `<ol>` are better used when meaning is applied like a recipe

2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?
    This can be changed with the `list-style-type` property in CSS.

3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unorder list` in your HTML document?
    Unordered list are better used for a collection of items that do not have a lot of meaning. These are typycally desplayed with a bullet style.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?
    Two ways the numbers can be changed are wtih `reverse` which specifies the list items are in the reverse order, or `start` to start numbering elements from letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv", use `start=4`

### Learn CSS

1. Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
    Margins role is to be the outermost layer in the The Box Model, and wrap the content whereas paddings role is around the content. They both come together to push items away from the box in "The Box Model".

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
   `<h1>` and `<p>`, use `block` by default. If the box has an outer display type of `inline`, then the box will break onto a new line, `width` and `height` properties will not apply. Elements like `<a>` use `inline` as their outer display.

### Learn JS

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
    Booleans, Numbers, Objects, Strings
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
    It is a valid array,as it is a multidimensional array with arrays nested inside of another array. Values can be access at the index using square brackets. For example `people[0][1]` would access 'pete' in the array. 

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
    * `=` Which an assignment operator which is used to assign a value to a variable.
    * `+=` The addition assignment operator adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
    * `**=` The exponentiation assignment operator raises the value of the variable to the power of the right operand. 
    *  `-=` The subtraction assignment operator subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
    *  `*=` The multiplication assignment operator multiplies a variable by the value o fthe right operand and assigns the result to the variable

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why. 
    It would evaluate to `10dog` because when a plus operator is in front of a boolean that boolean is converted to a number and false === 0 

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. 
    A conditional statement could be used in a video game to determine how many attempts the player has or it can be used for password verification. 


6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.  
    When you need to use a block of code multiple times.
