## What Growth Mindset means to me

Growth mindset to me means the ability to **perservere** and **adapt** throughout the learning process. It may be tempting at times while learning something new to give up because you are not understanding concepts as fast as your peers. When you are following the growth mindset you are not discouraged by these hardships. Growth mindset means that one understands learning struggles are completely normal and to be expected. It means allowing yourself to embrace the challenges you are faced and see them as **inspiration** and **motivation**. When you are following the growing mindset ~~giving up~~ should not be in your vocabulary. 

Below are a list of my reminders to maintain the growth mindset:
