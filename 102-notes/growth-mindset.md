## What Growth Mindset means to me

Growth mindset to me means the ability to **perservere** and **adapt** throughout the learning process. It may be tempting at times while learning something new to give up because you are not understanding concepts as fast as your peers. When you are following the growth mindset you are not discouraged by these hardships. Growth mindset means that one understands learning struggles are completely normal and to be expected. It means allowing yourself to embrace the challenges you are faced and see them as **inspiration** and **motivation**. When you are following the growing mindset ~~giving up~~ should not be in your vocabulary. 

Below are a list of my three reminders to maintain the growth mindset:

* **Reflection:** 
  
When I am feeling frustrated about my progress make sure to look back at my notes and remember how far I have come. It is very mportant to not be discouraged by imposter syndrome.
  


* **Engagement:** 

Engage with my peers and make sure to be active about asking questions when I need help. Set a timer for myself when I am stuck to make sure I am asking questions after I have hit a roadblock.



* **Recurpuration:**  

Allow myself time to step away from the content to refresh mentally with the material I am learning to avoid burnout and stay focused on my growth. As burnout can lead to a fixed mindset.
