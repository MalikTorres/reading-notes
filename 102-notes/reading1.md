# Markdown Notes

This is an outline of my notes from the readings about Markdown. 

**Markdown syntax notes**

* Markdown headers can also be created by using `===` syntax 
* Syntax for bold and italizing at the same time is triple atrstiks `***`
* underscores are created by ``***``
* blockquotes are ``>``
    *  Indented blockquotes ``>>``   
* ``/`` and escape are used to create list unordered list followed by periods
* angle brackets can be used to turn an email into a URL 

**Best Pratices**

1. Periods are best for list in place of paranthesis, as they are not always supported. 
2. Indent to create a nested list
3. Code blocks are normally indented four spaces.


**Things I would like to more about**

* Is when is it more effective to add more stylization to my markdown 

* Does inline styling with CSS add more clutter
