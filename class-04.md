## Class 4 Notes

### nosql vs sql 

What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

SQL databases are the best fit for complex query intensive enviornments whereas NoSQL databases are not a good fit. NoSQL databases don't have the ideal interfaces for complex queries.

What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases are the best fit for hierachical data stoarage as it follows the key value pair way of storing data, which is similar to JSON data.

Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

SQL databases require more adjustment and managment when scaling, you have to account for the increasing scale by making adjustments to the CPU, RAM, and SSD. Whereas, NoSQL databases only require a few more servers to account for the growing scale.

### sql modeling techniques

Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

They can be related based the category, like the example showed employer -> employee.

Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

To outline what your databases will look like, perhaps by drawing it out

Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

Primary keys - are uniquely identiy each row in a table. Tables typycally have one primary key, but can have more. 

Foreign Key - This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.



### sql vs nosql 

How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

SQl syntax uses `SELECT` and `FROM`


Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

This refers to the process of organizing a database into tables and colums. The three main forms are first normal form, second normal form, and third normal form. Acheiving this process is called **database normilization**.

Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter

This labeling refers to how many connections there are from table in a database to another. For example if it's a single connection, that would be referred to as one-to-one.

### Reflection
